To use: you can run ./viridian to run it from the current directory,
or you can install it using:
~# python setup.py install

If you have used Viridan before and found that an update has messed it up, 
open Viridian and go to Edit -> Preferences -> System and hit Reset Everything.

You can also do this manually by executing 
~$ rm -r ~/.viridian
