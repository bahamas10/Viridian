=== Viridan ===

Viridian is a front-end for an Ampache server (see http://ampache.org). 
Viridian is powered by python/pygtk.

=== Installing ===

To use: you can run ./viridian to run it from the current directory,
or you can install it using:
~# python setup.py install

=== Problems ===

If you have used Viridian before and found that an update has messed it up, 
open Viridian and go to Edit -> Preferences -> System and hit Reset Everything.

You can also do this manually by executing 
~$ rm -r ~/.viridian
